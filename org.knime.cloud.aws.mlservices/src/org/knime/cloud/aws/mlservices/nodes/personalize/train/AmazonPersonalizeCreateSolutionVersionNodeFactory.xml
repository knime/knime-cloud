	<name>Amazon Personalize Create Solution Version</name>
	<shortDescription>Creates a new Amazon Personalize solution version.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node creates a new solution version
			of either a newly created
			solution or an existing one with Amazon Personalize. It outputs
			metrics of the created solution version whereby higher values are
			better for each of the metrics. To create a solution, you can either
			use one of the (by Amazon) predefined recipes, use a user-defined
			recipe, or use AutoML. There are three types of recipes.
			<i>User
				personalization</i>
			recipes build models that give item
			recommendations for
			specific users,
			<i>Personalized ranking</i>
			recipes build models that
			can be used to do a personalized ranking of
			a
			list of items for a specific user, and
			<i>Related items</i>
			recipes build models that can be used to find items that are similar
			to a specific item. If you are using AutoML, Amazon automatically
			finds the best
			<i>User personalization</i>
			recipe for you by trying several recipes out.
			<br />
			You need to have at least one dataset group with interactions data to
			be able to create a solution. Use the
			<i>Amazon Personalize Upload Interactions</i>
			node to upload such data.
			<br />
			For deployment of a solution version, create a campaign with
			the
			<i>Amazon Personalize Create Campaign</i>
			node.
			<br />
			More
			information is available on the
			<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/">website</a>
			or in the
			<a
				href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/personalize-dg.pdf">documentation</a>
			.

			<i>Note:
				If
				the
				node execution is interrupted
				during
				the
				creation, e.g. by
				the user or due to lost of internet connection, the creation
				will
				still
				be
				completed
				on
				AWS,
				although the node does not execute
				successfully.

			<option name="Create a new solution and a version of it">If selected, you can create a new version with
				the following settings. There will also be one version of this
				solution created.
			</option>
			<option name="Dataset group">
				Specify the dataset group to create a solution
				from. See also
				<a

			</option>
			<option name="Solution name">
				Specify the name of the solution. See also

			</option>
			<option name="Perform hyperparameter optimization">
				If enabled, Amazon will automatically try to find
				the best
				hyperparameters. This usually results in a better model but
				will also
				take more time. See also

			<option name="Use a predefined recipe">
				If selected, you can select one of Amazons
				predefined recipes to use.
				<i>User

				recipes build models that give item
				recommendations for
				specific
				users,
				<i>Personalized ranking</i>
				recipes build models that
				can be used to do a personalized ranking of

			<option name="Use a user-defined recipe">
				If selected, specify the ARN of a user-defined
				recipe. It can
				be of
				any of the three recipe types. In the output you
				will find
				information about the type of recipe that has been used. See also
				<a

			</option>
			<option name="Use AutoML">
				If selected, Amazon automatically runs several
				recipes to find the
				one that fits the best. Only user
				personalization recipes are used.
				In the output you will find
				information about the best recipe. See

			<option name="Create a new solution of an existing solution">
				If selected, an existing solution can be
				selected. For this solution, a new version will be created.
			</option>
			<option
				name="Provide the solution version ARN as flow variable">If enabled, the ARN of the created solution version will be
				pushed
				out as flow variable. This can be convenient if you, e.g.,
				want to
				use the solution version to create a new campaign with
				afterwards.
