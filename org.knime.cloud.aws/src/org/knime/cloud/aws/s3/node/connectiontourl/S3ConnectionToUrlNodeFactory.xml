        <intro>
	        This node reads the Amazon S3 connection and generates a pre-signed URL that points to an Amazon S3 object.
	        The URL is only valid for a specific period of time. Upon expiry, the URL will no longer remain active and an 
	        attempt to access the URL once it has expired will generate an error. It is not needed to set the permission
	        to access the S3 object to public. Using the generated pre-signed URL, any KNIME reader can be utilized to 
	        directly read the S3 object without having to fetch the object locally first.
